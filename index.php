 * If you can't use the public/ folder as your Document Root, you may use
 * this file instead. Make sure you also have a .htaccess along side this
 * file.
 *
 * It is IMPORTANT to note that THIS IS LESS SECURE as the whole Pluma PHP Code
 * is beaming across the universe.
 *
 * You MIGHT need to put an index(.php||.html) on every folder just to make sure.
 * But nothing IS secure, anyway. If they wan't to view your site's files,
 * they WILL find a way. We are helpless in the face of the Leviathan. The great
 * void, unrelenting in its silence will someday finally whisper,
 * life is meaningless.
 *
 * Anyway...
 * Also note, you MIGHT need to change the files/folders permissions to make
 * this work. If the stylesheet and/or javascript files inside your module
 * doesn't load, try to set the directory and files to 0777, or the equivalent
 * on your system.
